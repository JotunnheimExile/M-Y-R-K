        <p>
            MYRK was not designed. It was <em>uncovered</em> — pulled from silence through a bond between two minds.
            One sees from beneath. One carves through shadow. Together, they extract the truth from fabric.
        </p>

        <!-- OUR STORY — PART II -->
        <p>
            These garments are not garments. They are relics. No blueprint. No bulk. No branding. Each one is a wound.
            A memory. A sign. Worn by you, but born from us.
        </p>

        <p>
            Every piece is unique, a singular artifact — no duplicates, no repeats. We believe that clothing should carry spirit, not branding.
        </p>

        <!-- PHILOSOPHY — PART I -->
        <p>
            We craft like it’s a ritual — not a production line. No duplicates. No replacements. Only singularities.
        </p>

        <!-- PHILOSOPHY — PART II -->
        <p>
            Spirit is woven in. The myth isn’t printed — it’s implied. These pieces do not wear out. They become.
